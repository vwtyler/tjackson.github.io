Hi, I'm Tyler.

I document practical engineering work from real deployments, with a focus on reliability and operator-friendly systems.

Right now this includes:

- KAAD-LP / kaad-one broadcast and streaming infrastructure work
- Homelab and self-hosted systems design, operations, and troubleshooting

Most posts are written as implementation notes and case studies with concrete configs, commands, and lessons learned.

## Why Donate

I publish this work openly so other builders and small teams can reuse it.

Your support helps me:

- Keep documentation current and public
- Spend more time writing complete technical walkthroughs
- Build and maintain practical tools and workflows

If these posts saved you time or helped you avoid an outage, a donation keeps the work moving.
